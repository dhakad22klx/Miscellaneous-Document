/==============================/Namaste JavaScript Tutorials

1. Javascript is a synchronous single theaded language.
2. Everything javaScript happens inside "execution context". And whenever a function or miniprogramm (in case of js )  new execution context is created.
3. Callstack maintains the order of execution of execution contexts.
4. Temporal Dead Zone : It is the time between let 'a' given memory space till it get initialized.
5. We get reference error if we access a variable inside temporal dead zone.
6. Function along with lexical scope bundled together forms a closure that's known as closure.
7. Uses of Closures
   -Module Design Pattern 
   -Currying 
   -Function like once
   -Memoize
   -Maintaining state in async world
   -setTimeouts 
   -iterators
   -Manymore....
   
8. Functional statement (functional declaration) are hoisted ,but functional expression are not.
9. Ability of functions to be used as values and can be passed as arguments or (returned from) in another function, this ability  is known as First class
   Functions.
  --> A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. 
  For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be 
  assigned as a value to a variable.
10. Callbacks functions that comes from promises and mutation observer are placed in Microtask queue and other callback functions are placed in Callback 
    Queue(task queue).
